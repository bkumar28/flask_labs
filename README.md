#  Mini Flask Projects & API Experiments

A curated collection of small, self-contained Flask projects and API experiments.

This repository serves as a sandbox for learning, building, and rapidly prototyping Flask-based applications â€” covering authentication, RESTful APIs, JWT, database integrations, and more. It's ideal for quick iterations, exploring ideas, and developing modular microservices.
